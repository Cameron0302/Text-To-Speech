# Text-To-Speech
Text To Speech is an open source VBScript that allows you to type what you want the computer to say, and it will then be spoken using SAPI (Speech Application Programming Interface), it can run on Windows 7 through Windows 11.
# How do I install/run
Simply download TextToSpeech.vbs and open the file, the rest of the process after running is very self explanatory.
